         * Offsets into an ELF file can be 32-bit or 64-bit depending on the file
         * format, a concept introduced in the DWARF-3 standard.  The file format has
         * absolutely nothing to do with the address size and is determined by a
         * special encoding of the compile unit header.  This means that a 64-bit
         * format DWARF section on a 32bit address size is legal DWARF, albeit pretty
         * damn silly.  Note that as NovaProva mmap()s the executable to read the DWARF
         * information, a compile unit actually large enough to need the 64-bit format
         * cannot be mmap()ed and thus cannot be read on a 32-bit architecture.  So on
         * a 32-bit architecture we define np::spiegel::offset_t as a 32-bit quantity
         * and reject the 64-bit DWARF format as soon as we see it; on a 64-bit
         * architecture we handle both file formats at runtime.
